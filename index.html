        My full name is Cameron Jamaal Forrest, but most of my friends call me bam. I graduated from the Illustrious Tennessee State Univrsity with a BA i Business Information Systems. I'm from a city that is known for its music, but no it is not the country genre. It's actually know for it's down south Blues and yes im talking about good ole Memphis.

        So far this homework assignment is a littl easier than the first. I couldnt get the section and aside to fit in same box. But I will just come back to that later on. 
        <br>
    <p>Hopefully I didnt jinx myself, and hopefully its just me getting better. I came back to add more to this paragraph because I did indeed jinx myself. I stayed up till midnight trying to figure out an issue on accident. At that point I wasnt going in to work the next day so I sat around and watched the game of thrones to clear my mind. But today when I went to work it just all started clicking.
